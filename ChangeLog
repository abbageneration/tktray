	* tktray.c: applied patch from Sergey Golovan (thanks):
	image lookup by name is now dynamic (where it's needed).

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: applied patch from Sergey Golovan:
	don't register package when runtime Tcl version is lower
	than build-time version.

	* tclconfig: replaced with the latest TEA files.

	* Makefile.in: minor modifications for newer autoconf
	* configure: regenerated

	* tktray.c (TrayIconObjectCmd): added "bbox" command,
	because [winfo root*] happens to be unreliable in case of
	embedded windows.

	Initial release.
	Tested with trayer 1.0, gnome-panel 2.10.2.
